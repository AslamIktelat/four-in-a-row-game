# four-in-a-row-game

A final project in C sharp .net course, the project is a multiplayer game that has a client-side and service side.

To start a game a player has to invite another player from the online list if the second player accepts the invitation a game board is opened for each client.

The database is managed at the service side,it includes a games table and players table which saves the user name and the hashed password.

The service is built to transform messages to client and from client to client therefore it's duplex-based.
